# Pipe Dream

Connect the start (left most pipe) to end pipes (right most pipe) before the water catches up and spills!

## Instructions

- Construct a path out of pipes from the pile and place them by clicking on the squares on the board
- Water starts flowing when time reaches 0
- Pipes can be replaced if water hasn't passed through them yet
- The longer the path from start to end the higher the score will be
