# Pipe Dream

## Instructions

- Connect the starting pipe (left most pipe) with the end pipe (right most pipe) by clicking on the squares.
- The Pile of pipes on the left is a queue of pipe types with the lowest pipe being the top of the queue.
- Placing a pipe on a square will move the pipe from the top of the queue to the square and replace the existing pipe if the square is not empty
- You can only replace pipes that haven't been passed by water yet.
- The longer the path from start to end the higher the score will be.
